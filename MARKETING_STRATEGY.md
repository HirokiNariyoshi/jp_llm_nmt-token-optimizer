# Marketing Strategy for llm_nmt-token-optimizer

## Project Positioning for Recruiters

### Elevator Pitch

"Built a Python library that reduces LLM token usage by 58% for Japanese users by exploiting tokenizer inefficiencies. Demonstrates understanding of:

- LLM tokenization and economics
- System design and optimization
- Python software engineering
- Open source development"

### Key Metrics to Highlight

- **58% token reduction** - Quantifiable business impact
- **Zero API costs** - Works with free local Ollama models
- **Clean architecture** - Modular, testable, documented
- **Professional git history** - Shows good dev practices

## Action Items

### Phase 1: GitHub Polish (This Week)

- [ ] Add GitHub topics: `llm`, `optimization`, `japanese`, `ollama`, `tokenization`
- [ ] Create a demo GIF showing the tool in action
- [ ] Add a "Motivation" or "Why This Matters" section to README
- [ ] Pin this repo on your GitHub profile
- [ ] Add proper LICENSE file (MIT recommended)

### Phase 2: Content Creation (Next 2 Weeks)

- [ ] Write a blog post on Medium/Dev.to about the discovery
- [ ] Create a LinkedIn post with demo + metrics
- [ ] Post on Reddit (r/MachineLearning, r/LLM, r/Python)
- [ ] Twitter/X thread with visualizations
- [ ] Make a 2-minute demo video for YouTube

### Phase 3: Resume Integration

- [ ] Add to resume projects section with metrics
- [ ] Prepare 2-minute verbal explanation for interviews
- [ ] Create talking points about technical decisions
- [ ] List specific technologies/skills demonstrated

### Phase 4: Networking

- [ ] Share with professors/mentors
- [ ] Post in university CS/AI groups
- [ ] Reach out to AI company employees on LinkedIn
- [ ] Submit to "Show HN" on Hacker News

## Resume Bullet Points (Choose 2-3)

### Technical Focus

- "Developed Python library reducing LLM token usage by 58% for Japanese queries through automated translation optimization"
- "Architected modular system integrating Ollama, Google Translate, and tiktoken with clean separation of concerns"
- "Implemented compare mode for accurate token measurement by querying models in both languages"

### Business Impact Focus

- "Created cost optimization tool saving 58% on LLM API costs for non-English users"
- "Identified and exploited tokenizer inefficiency affecting Japanese users, quantifying 3-5x token inflation"
- "Built open-source solution with 0 dependencies on paid APIs using local Ollama models"

### Engineering Focus

- "Engineered production-ready Python package with comprehensive documentation, type hints, and modular design"
- "Maintained clean git history with conventional commits demonstrating professional development practices"
- "Designed flexible API supporting multiple LLM providers with focus on Ollama local inference"

## Interview Talking Points

### What problem does it solve?

"LLM tokenizers are optimized for English. Japanese text uses 3-5x more tokens for the same meaning.
By translating to English first, processing, then translating back, we save ~58% of tokens.
This makes local models more viable and reduces API costs."

### Why is this impressive?

"It's a systems thinking problem - I identified an economic inefficiency in how LLMs are priced,
quantified the impact, and built a practical solution. It demonstrates understanding of:

- LLM internals (tokenization)
- Cost optimization
- Software architecture
- The intersection of business and technical concerns"

### Technical challenges?

"Key challenges were:

1. Measuring actual token usage vs estimates (solved with compare_mode)
2. Handling translation quality/errors gracefully
3. Designing a clean API that's simple but extensible
4. Making it work with free tools (Ollama + Google Translate)"

### What would you add next?

"Potential enhancements:

- Support for more languages (Korean, Chinese, Arabic)
- Caching layer for common translations
- Web UI for non-technical users
- Benchmarking across different models
- Integration with LangChain/LlamaIndex"

## Content Ideas

### Blog Post: "I Saved 58% on LLM Tokens with This One Weird Trick"

1. The Discovery (testing showed Japanese uses way more tokens)
2. The Hypothesis (what if we translate first?)
3. The Implementation (architecture overview)
4. The Results (real benchmarks with data)
5. The Implications (economic inefficiency, tokenizer bias)

### LinkedIn Post Template

"🚀 Just open-sourced a tool that reduces LLM token usage by 58% for Japanese users.

The problem: LLM tokenizers are optimized for English. Japanese text uses 3-5x more tokens.

The solution: Translate to English → Process → Translate back

Result: 58% token savings with minimal quality loss

Built with Python, Ollama, Google Translate. Works completely free on local models.
